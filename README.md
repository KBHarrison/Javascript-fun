Simple js homework assignment

Write a JavaScript program (embedded in a web page) that includes methods to do the following:

Compute the ith Fibonacci number (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …)

Compute n! (factorial) for integer n ≥ 0

Compute the sum of all integers between two given integers (inclusive)

Given a number of cents, print to the browser console the corresponding U.S. coins that total to the given number.  Print the solution that needs the fewest coins.  Only use pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters.  Example: for 113, the answer is “4 quarters”, “1 dime”, “3 pennies”.  Do not print the case where the solution calls for 0 of the coin (e.g. don’t print “0 nickels”).  Use the singular word if the value is 1, or the plural if the coin count is greater than 1
